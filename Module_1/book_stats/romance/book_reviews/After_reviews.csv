22557520,After,Mila Temnyalova,58,85,1,"January 2, 2015","I don't normally read fan fiction on Wattpad. One Direction fanfiction, even less so. But given that this trilogy nearly has one BILLION reads altogether, I thought to myself: this can't be that bad -- after all, it's literally the most popular unpublished trilogy on the internet right now. I should give it a try.And I regret it. I'm never again judging a book by its popularity. I honestly have no idea how the movie rights for this were bought, much less how a Big Six publishing house like Simon & Schuster actually agreed to publish it! The plot is like the other 90% of the stories on wattpad involving good girls and bad boys, only it includes the infamous Harry Styles, which is probably the only reason why it has accumulated so many views. And let me tell you, I can name at least thirty stories that are based on the same idea but are written ten times better. Yet somehow they didn't make Wattpad blow up as much as After did.They say that this is the new 50 shades of grey. I admit that I haven't read James' books but the situation does seem similar: 50 shades was initially a Twilight fan fiction, was it not? And this 1D fanfic is ''the next big thing'' with bidders for the movie and the publishing rights. God forbid it ever became a best seller. Books like A Proscriptive Relationship, Love at Last Sight, Late Summer Rain: that's what Wattpad's about, and that's what should be made popular by Wattpad. If After gets published with ''made popular by Wattpad'' on its front cover, I will be very disappointed because the last thing I want to see is fiction like this representing a community filled with brilliant authors.This, however, was so poorly written that I'm having a hard time grasping how the editor is going to make it better. Not only that, but the plot itself lacks any depth whatsoever: at least some of the similar stories I've read actually carried a message. This story does not. It is not based on love, it is based on lust. It does not portray an honest and evolving relationship. Instead, it's centered around a boy with serious anger management issues and a lovestruck girl who barely knows him but will put up with anything. The majority of the chapters consist of him abusing her emotionally and then making it all better through make up sex. It does not even follow a story line: it's chapter after chapter of the same thing.No. Just no. Absolutely no meaning. Absolutely no depth. Absolutely no character development. Absolutely no plot development. Absolutely nothing.Perhaps after its publishing it will get better. Maybe, just maybe, I'll actually bother to finish the trilogy. I would never buy this, but I would be willing to finish it on Wattpad -- although I suspect it will not get edited theре. So that's an unlikely scenario.But until I see a more decent version, I'll be stuck here wondering how many of the people who made this story so popular are over 13 years of age.(And mind you, I'd consider After 18+.)Sorry for being harsh. But this story does not even deserve one star in my eyes.","1,161",77

22557520,After,Angela,582,1254,3,"December 30, 2022","You can go ahead and judge me for reading this, it’s okay really, I’m already judging myself for it. When I first heard of/picked up After and saw that it was originally 1direction fan-fiction I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard in my life. Then I kept seeing people post pictures and reviews on it all talking about how they are now hooked on this series. It physically hurts me to say this, but I’m hooked too. After is the epitome of what most would call “a guilty pleasure read”. I have never, ever hated two characters more than I hate Tessa and Hardin.Tessa is: Whiny, stuck up, annoying, childish, pathetic, a H2ho, immature, irresponsible, vapid, shallow, and an overall turd. Tessa spends 90% of this book crying and the other 10% of the time coming up with reasons to cry again.Hardin is: cocky, annoying, bizarre, stage five clinger, gross, immature, actually a woman, hot tempered, mental, and zero dark crazy. I have no doubt in my mind that Hardin is the girl in this relationship. Trust me when I say he is more pathetic than Tessa is.That is just the tip of the iceberg on the things I loathe about these two. The relationship between the two is not only unhealthy but just downright awful. It’s unbalanced and almost always one sided. Their relationship is the furthest thing from romantic. Not only did I hate them when they were separate but I hated them more when they were together. Their relationship is way out in the deep end of the crazy pool and it was so bad I wanted to drown just trying to endure it.As far as the plot goes, there’s not much of one. It’s just 600 pages of a rinse and repeat story line. Hardin acts like a dick, ask Tessa for one more chance, Tessa says okay, they make up for a day, and then the cycle starts all over again. No seriously, that’s the whole story, nothing else to it. Personally, I will say that I think people are a little harsh on Todd’s writing. Yes, it’s not the best, but I’ve definitely seen worse. It’s just light writing. You’re never going to have to Google something that is said, or have to set the book aside because it gets to deep, but it’s not the worst of the worst.After lacks any and all originality, depth, and personality. But, you want to know what the worst part is? The downright dirty worst part?!.. Is that I couldn’t put this book down. It was like watching a car crash in slow motion. I wanted to look away but just couldn’t! And just when I think I’ll finally be able to shake the madness of this book off Anna Todd hit me hard with a WTF ending, that I didn’t see coming.
  
  
    
  
I hate admitting that even though I hated everything about this book, there was just something about it that kept me coming back for more.",410,55
22557520,After,booksnpenguins (wingspan matters),689,1649,1,"January 8, 2023","Before you read this, please remember that this is my own personal opinion and that, with this very negative review, I'm by no means bashing those who liked this book or related to its characters.
  
That being said, I think this is the first time in my reading experience where I wish I could rate a book -5 stars. Why? Because After is the most horrible thing I've ever read in my life.It praises moral/verbal abuse and very unhealty relationships. Not to mention the slut-shaming and the way it speaks to good girls as if being naive and inexperienced is something they need to fix right away. Sorry to bother you, Anna Todd, but 1940 called to say it wants its mysogyny back when you're done using it. I mean, I've read bad books before, and I sometimes found myself even liking them or what you may call problematic characters, anyway, but this? This is not problematic, this not even slightly twisted. This is a straight up mess that was most certainly created for the sole erotic purpose and the ""plot"" that was attached to it for the sake of calling it a book and not fan-fiction, is just funfetti. (speaking of fan-fiction; I thought it was a running joke I didn't understand but it turns out this REALLY is a freaking wattpad monster. And it was based on no other than the cutiepie that is Harry Styles?? I'd sue if I were him, no joking intended.)The main character is one of the most unrelatable, annoying, judgy girls I've ever encountered in books (say hi, Lara Jean), and Hardin, her male counterpart, should really consider therapy or else self-employ himself in a circus because he's nothing but a rabied bear. If he doesn't, please someone come collect him and lock him away where he can't harm anyone anymore. He's so scary, moody and crazy I was afraid he'd jump out the pages and scold me for reading. Imagine what a happy relationship these two must have. Of course, there's the sex - another meh to add to the collection - that should patch all this up, but not even all the positions of Kamasutra could save these two and their madness. Hardin makes Christian Grey look like a maltese teacup and Tessa should move stares, buy a vibrator if it's the sex she needs to function, or simply learn to love herself. Also, the stereotypes killed me. In this book people are evilized or seen as the bad guys because they have tattoos and piercings, dye their hair, have casual sex and wear tight clothes. Should I tell 9o% of people I know they're walking disasters or should I recommend them this book so they can find out themselves? Character development? Redemption? You won't find them here or in any other book of the series. This story left me so uncomfortable and shaken that I had to finish a whole jar of pickles to get over it.Again, if you liked it, I'm happy for you, but I will never understand how this is considered 'a masterpiece', or where it got all its success. Sometimes, fanfictions should stay fanfictions. I wish I could unread it or at least forget stories as toxic as this one are being published and praised for their portrayal of romance like it's nothing, while real works of art get rejected every day.Honestly, just slap a dark romance tag on this, already, and let readers know it's full of shit you can romanticize all you want as long as you recognize it's questionable in terms of morality.edit Oct. 10 2019I just watched the movie because it was on and I had no idea I was watching it until names were made. I kept watching it because I wanted to see if maybe it suffered from the Twilight Effect which imo made the movies more tolerable than the books (I'm still crying over that long khaki skirt) buuuuut nope. Movie adaptation not doing it for me, either.I must admit that it was slightly less cringy than the books, tho, but only a bit. Those longing looks, the Truth or Dare, the peer pressure, the slut/purity-shaming and fighting were more than enough to last for weeks. The actors were good and extremely pretty, so I'm giving the movie an additional quarter of a star for this! And, why not, I'm also giving myself 10 gold star for the effort of not throwing my remote to the TV.🚩𝙿𝙾𝚂𝚂𝙸𝙱𝙻𝙴 𝙿𝚁𝙾𝙱𝙻𝙴𝙼𝙰𝚃𝙸𝙲 𝙲𝙾𝙽𝚃𝙴𝙽𝚃 𝙰𝙻𝙴𝚁𝚃!*🚩*𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚋𝚘𝚘𝚔 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚒𝚗𝚜 𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚜, 𝚜𝚒𝚝𝚞𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚜, 𝚌𝚑𝚊𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚜 𝚊𝚗𝚍/𝚘𝚛 𝚛𝚎𝚕𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚑𝚒𝚙𝚜 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝚖𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚛 𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚋𝚕𝚎𝚖𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚌/𝚝𝚘𝚡𝚒𝚌/𝚍𝚊𝚛𝚔 𝚘𝚛 𝚘𝚟𝚎𝚛𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚖𝚘𝚛𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚢 𝚚𝚞𝚎𝚜𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚊𝚋𝚕𝚎.𝙸, 𝚊𝚜 𝚊 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍𝚎𝚛 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚌𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚘𝚛 𝚘𝚏 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚛𝚎𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚠, 𝚊𝚌𝚔𝚗𝚘𝚠𝚕𝚎𝚍𝚐𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚔𝚒𝚗𝚍 𝚘𝚏 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚎𝚗𝚝 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚒𝚝𝚜 𝚗𝚎𝚐𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚟𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚜, 𝚊𝚗𝚍, 𝚠𝚒𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚕𝚒𝚖𝚒𝚝𝚜 𝚘𝚏 𝚖𝚢 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚝 𝚣𝚘𝚗𝚎, 𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚘𝚜𝚎 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚝𝚘 𝚕𝚎𝚝 𝚒𝚝 𝚊𝚏𝚏𝚎𝚌𝚝 𝚖𝚢 𝚎𝚗𝚓𝚘𝚢𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝 𝚘𝚛 𝚘𝚙𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚘𝚗, 𝚋𝚎𝚌𝚊𝚞𝚜𝚎:-𝙸 𝚔𝚗𝚘𝚠 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚍𝚒𝚏𝚏𝚎𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎 𝚋𝚎𝚝𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚗 𝚏𝚒𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚕𝚒𝚝𝚢;-𝙸 𝚍𝚘𝚗'𝚝 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚗𝚎 𝚌𝚎𝚛𝚝𝚊𝚒𝚗 𝚋𝚎𝚑𝚊𝚟𝚒𝚘𝚛𝚜 𝚒𝚗 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚕 𝚕𝚒𝚏𝚎;-𝚊𝚗𝚢 𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚞𝚊𝚕 𝚕𝚒𝚔𝚎 𝚘𝚛 𝚍𝚒𝚜𝚕𝚒𝚔𝚎 𝚝𝚘𝚠𝚊𝚛𝚍𝚜 𝚌𝚎𝚛𝚝𝚊𝚒𝚗 ""𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚋𝚕𝚎𝚖𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚌"" 𝚋𝚘𝚘𝚔𝚜/𝚛𝚎𝚕𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚑𝚒𝚙𝚜/𝚌𝚑𝚊𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚜, 𝚍𝚘𝚗'𝚝 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚜𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍𝚗'𝚝 𝚍𝚎𝚏𝚒𝚗𝚎 𝚖𝚎 𝚊𝚜 𝚊 𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚜𝚘𝚗;-𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚜 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚓𝚞𝚜𝚝 𝚐𝚘𝚝𝚝𝚊 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍 𝙾𝙽𝙴 𝙾𝙵 𝚃𝙷𝙾𝚂𝙴 𝙱𝙾𝙾𝙺𝚂, 𝚢'𝚔𝚗𝚘𝚠?",394,38
22557520,After,human,628,932,1,"February 24, 2021","(0.25/5: 0.1 for Landon, 0.1 for Noah, 0.05 for Steph. That's it. Fuck everyone else.)Shoutout to the Cursed Books Club, without whom this rant would not be possible, because I would have committed arson gone insane two days ago.Real footage of me being convinced to read this.Here's your spoiler warning because I honestly have no patience to be funny right now. This book was terrible. I'm going to talk about everything that I found problematic or even vaguely annoying in this book. Please keep all trigger warnings in mind while reading this review. If you enjoyed this book and think I should have as well, I don't want to hear it. Otherwise, well, have fun.TW/CW: rape, slut-shaming, emotional/domestic abuse, descriptive sex, drinking, alcoholism, past trauma, peer-pressure, general nastiness.(To everyone who has been anticipating this review, apologies that it has taken me a week to type up. Apparently thinking about 'After' for any period of time makes me prone to fits of fury and general rage. Sorry about that.)Objectively, 'After' is the worst book I've ever read. It has absolutely everything, and to top it all off, it's Harry Styles Wattpad fanficton. This book honestly infuriated me even more than Ignite Me did, and that's saying something. However, unlike 'Ignite Me', 'After' also had exactly three somewhat redeemable points.(That's not saying much, because the entire book is a sea of 'nope', with about three droplets of 'not-as-shitty-as-the-rest-of-it'.)Real footage of my braincells dropping dead because of this dumpster fire.'After' tries to tell the story of Tessa Young, a perfect little college student whose life is turned absolutely upside down after meeting bad boy Harry Styles Hardin Scott, because of a relationship that is as long as it is fun to read about. So that is to say, not fun long at all.Tessa is your classic good girl. All she does is study and never has any fun. She just wants to be successful in life and not get in trouble, and is therefore not like other teenagers, let alone other girls. Logic 100. Additionally, because of her financial situation, despite her AmAzInG gRaDeS she only applies to one school. Not even ONE safety school. Logic 1000.As you can see, Tessa is the smartest person on the planet, ever. When she meets Hardin, things aren't exactly off to a great start for this pErFeCt CoUpLe. She goes as far as to acknowledge that she's judging him for his tattoos and piercings, but turns right around and says that she's being polite. She claIMS THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS. SHE INSINUATES THAT PEOPLE WITH OCD ARE CRAZY.*visibly attempts to remain sane*She hates Steph, her roommate, on-site because she wears revealing clothes and has tattoos/piercings. (I actually somewhat liked Steph because she defends Tessa and remains supportive of her even when Tessa is so outright judgemental about her, even if Steph peer-pressures Tessa somewhat.) This brings us to one of the biggest problems with this book: all the slut-shaming.You see, Tessa holds herself in such high regard because of how 'perfect' and 'innocent' she is. She hates everyone who ""looks different"", especially girls who dress differently from how she does. It gets particularly worse when a side character, Molly, is introduced.Girl-on-girl hate reaches its peak in this book, because Molly exists solely to make Tessa jealous, and she goes as far as to call Molly a 'skank' and a 'whore' multiple times. Just because Molly used to sleep with Hardin. Which Tessa now does.((Call-out paragraph for Tessa's mother, who takes one look at the band posters, piercings, and pentagrams black leather, and demands that Tessa change dorms, and occasionally shows up from time to time. No joke. Tessa's mother is more of a Karen than the character named 'Karen' in this book.))Tessa goes to a party with some other people and drinks for the first time. She stumbles into a bedroom with books in it. Because Tessa is the most intelligent of all intellectuals, her favorite book is 'Wuthering Heights', which she notices with the books. Just as she sits down to read it, Hardin walks into the room. We learn that not only is Hardin a bad boy, but an intellectual because he reads ✨classics✨.There is instant kemistree between the two of them, and we know this because we get more descriptions of Hardin's eyes than what goes on at school. In one of the few chapters that we do get to see what goes on at school, Tessa befriends Landon, who turns out to be Hardin's step-brother, but is one of the only characters I actually liked because of how genuinely nice he is.Apart from all of that, Tessa has actually had a boyfriend this entire time - Noah. Noah is also nice but basically has no role in the story other than to build part of Tessa's love triangle. He's worried about Tessa and calls her mother on a few occasions, on account of how Tessa seems unable to make good decisions anymore.Time passes, drunken games of truth-or-dare are played, and Hardin and Tessa decide to try to be friends. They decide to go out one day......and Hardin fingers her at a lake.Tessa comes to the conclusion that she doesn't want to be with Noah, but actually Hardin. Of course, for how smart she is, Tessa can't figure out how to break up with him, bEcAuSe ThEy'Ve BeEn BeSt FrIeNdS fOrEvEr. So, basically, it's okay to cheat on your boyfriend if you ✨feel bad✨ about it. She repeatedly acknowledges that cheating is wrong but continues to do it because she's nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs.The level of drama in this book genuinely rivals that of a soap opera. Noah finds out that Tessa has been cheating on him with Hardin in the most dramatic way possible, but decides that he can put it behind them if Tessa stops seeing Hardin. So she does.Kidding! Of course not! Tessa and Hardin get caught by Landon of all people and continue messing around with each other. Poor Noah finds out about them again and they properly break up.And so begins a disturbing montage of push-and-pull between Tessa and Hardin, as they decide to properly date. Except not really. Hardin starts oPeNiNg Up to Tessa, and shows her a SoFtEr SiDe of him, which convinces her that he really does like her, but just feels conflicted sometimes. So when the two of them argue (which is almost constantly), instead of standing up for herself, Tessa thinks that it's better for her to just be quiet and let him work through it. Hardin will yell at her, and then thirty seconds later we're getting ghastly descriptions of him going down on her. All while being told how rOmAnTiC he is.This brings us to the biggest problem of the book: the relationship itself. Tessa and Hardin's relationship is emotionally and at times physically abusive. Hardin manipulates Tessa to the point where she thinks that their relationship is normal. Hardin is actually so terrible that everytime he acts even remotely decent, he is lauded for how incredible he is.He also constantly called Tessa 'bAbY', which absolutely grated on my nerves. If I ever have to hear that word again, I am going to ✨yeet myself into a void✨ and die a traumatized human.Hardin is terrible to everyone, a behavior which seems to stem from the fact that his father was a neglectful alcoholic at one point. And so because of that, Hardin is still incredibly disrespectful to his father, his step-mother, his step-brother, and the world at large.There's one scene in particular that comes to my mind. Tessa is screaming about how miserable she is when she's with Hardin, and how being with him was terrible for her. She acknowledges that his behavior is borderline sociopathic, and tells him that he brings out the worst in her.His response? That even though he brings out the worst in her, she brings out the best in him, so it's good for them to stay together.Yeah. uMM-AKA Hardin in a gif.To make matters worse, they move in together. Tessa's mother shows up, and drama ensues.However I'd like to point out one VERY big problem with this: Tessa doesn't really know Hardin. She met him, what, 6 months ago, when she started college? She doesn't even know his favorite color, let alone who he truly is. He could be an axe-murderer for all she knows, luring her into a false sense of security, getting her to trust him completely and abandon all of her friends only to betray her in the worst way at the end.Oh wait.Tessa also gets an internship at Vance Publishing, where she gets her own office and basically reads manuscripts all day. I'd like to point out that Tessa is a COLLEGE. STUDENT. If she spends all day at her internship, and all night fucking Hardin, where the hell does she find the time to go to classes? Does she even go to classes?? What about hOMEWORK???One day, Hardin stays out all night and refuses to tell Tessa where he had been. It's clear to her that he has been drinking, even though he had initially claimed to almost never drink although he spends a good portion of this book drunk, but we're not going to start questioning that now.Tessa decides that she's going to be strict with him, and tells him that she isn't going to sleep with him that night, or something. He tells her something along the lines of ""bUt YoU kNoW i GeT nIgHtMaReS wHeN i DoN't SlEeP wItH yOu"" (which, hey, again, manipulation!), and explains why: when he was really young, he saw his mother raped in front of him, and has had nightmares ever since.I know, that's a terrible thing to happen to someone, especially at a young age. But what does giving Hardin a tragic backstory do, other than ""excuse"" him for his disgusting behavior? Absolutely nothing. Trying to garner sympathy because you witnessed something that horrible is not okay. It does not, in any way, shape, or form give you special permission to treat everyone like dirt.Things actually seem to get better between Tessa and Hardin, to the point where he acts like a decent human being at his father's wedding. Of course, they have sex. However, things aren't adding up, and Tessa decides to go meet Steph (who, surprise surprise, is still alive!) and the rest of their friends.When she gets to the restaurant where they're all meeting, she finds Hardin with Molly and immediately sees red. She demands an explanation from everyone there and finds out that her relationship with Hardin thus far has been a farce. It was all a bet to find out who could take Tessa's virginity first.Definitely didn't see that coming.Tessa leaves the restaurant in a heartbroken fury, all whilst Hardin attempts to console her, and claims that he had never meant to hurt her, and all sorts of irritating drivel. Tessa and Hardin's relationship right now. Probably. Hopefully.And so this dreadful dumpster fire goes out. Except not really, because there are four more books. I'd like to think that Tessa really means it, splits with Hardin for real, and gets her life back on track, but something tells me not to be optimistic.All of that being said, if you think about it, there's really no plot whatsoever. It's just a couple of college kids being horny and making bad decisions. We're not even going to talk about character development, because it's nonexistent. The writing was simultaneously slow and rushed, and ultimately very painful to read.The narrator was... oh god. Let's not even talk about this. The narrator must have been desperate to go through with all of this, but their voice only made it worse for me.That's actually a lie. I managed to make my way through this book, didn't I?There's just one last thing I'd like to address: the 60,000 five-star ratings. To everyone who gave this book that high a rating, I'd just like to know one thing: why??? There's literally no redeemable aspect of this book. It isn't even remotely fun. The smut is dry and stale. Hardin's relationship with Tessa is disturbing and abusive. Harding isn't even hot!Essentially this book accomplishes two things:1.) Embodies every terrible trope that is characteristic of Wattpad fanfiction, and2.) Tells readers that the sort of relationship Tessa and Hardin have is okay. That it's perfectly fine, good even, to be emotionally abused the way Tessa is in the book if he's ""hot"" and has a tragic past. (If I'm being completely honest, however, it is difficult for me to even show any sympathy for Tessa because of how awful and hypocritical she is.)Live footage of me yeeting all my memories of this book.So yeah. I'm done.Pray for my braincells. ✌~~~~~~~~i know i said i would never read thisbut here we are.buddy read with the cursed books club!

I’m not a fan of Harry Styles or One Direction (haha this has since changed), but I honestly just wanted to read it so that I could form my own opinion of it and let you guys know how I felt about it.I want to start off by saying that this was a Harry Styles fanfiction on wattpad that received so many views that it got published. Anna Todd has never written anything else and it’s a fanfiction, so I had to take that on board when I started reading it, but I was genuinely surprised. I understand where people are coming from when they say that Tessa and Hardin’s relationship is abusive. But I watched an interview with the author and I thought it was so interesting. She straight up said that he’s a bad person and that not all people are good. This story is realistic in that sense. Everyone has issues and he’s obviously trying to deal with those, but it’s obvious to anyone who reads this book that he’s trying so hard to change. When this is all he’s ever known, how can he just all of a sudden forget all of his past issues and be a good person? That’s just not realistic. That’s what I liked about After, that it depicted something that wasn’t necessarily good or healthy, but it was real. I think I may have hated this book if Tessa just took the abuse and kept crawling back to him, but she doesn’t. She sticks up for herself and is a feisty, independent character who knows what she wants, and she will tell him if he needs to get back in line and I really, really appreciated this. I don’t think this book is glamorising abusive relationships. I think it’s teaching people empathy, that not all people are perfect and how to stick up for yourself – not only did she stick up for herself to Hardin, but also to her mother.Going into this, I thought it would be all about the romance, but it’s not. It’s got so many other aspects in it that revolve around family, friends, university and work life. This isn’t just a love story, it’s a coming of age story. Tessa really grows as a person and realises what she wants in life and I admire that. Obviously this wasn’t going to be the most beautifully written book out there, but it sure was addicting and I raced through the almost 600 pages in less than 3 days. I grew to really care for these characters and want the best for them. Just know that I understand where the haters are coming from, but Hardin is changing for the better and is trying so hard to be good for Tessa and Tessa is a badass who can hold her own and is trying to help Hardin get over his past and become a better person. And that’s what matters, that he’s trying and that she has the compassion to help him. I am so surprised that I didn’t turn out to be one of the people hating on this book, and I’m so glad I gave it a chance. Don’t be embarrassed to read this book because of all of the hate it’s receiving. I say to give it a go and form your own opinion and I ask you not to judge it based on the fact that it’s a fanfiction. I don’t recommend this book for younger readers as there is explicit sex, swearing, drug and alcohol references and is just generally not for younger readers. ",319,37
22557520,After,peachygirl,266,630,1,"December 5, 2021","I read After when it was 'The Book' on wattpad a few years back and I'm embarrassed to admit that I read all the 3 books in the series (the original one before Ms.Todd decided to milk this for all it's worth and came up with more unnecessary drama in an already fucked up relationship). In my defense, I wanted to see if the girl would grow some balls and dump Harry's sorry ass, which does happen time and again, till Harry strips and Tessa falls head over heels in lust. Needless to say I was repulsed.The girl in me hated the character Harry/Hardin. But the reader in me was furious with the way the author romanticised every red flag and abuse. Still I suffered 300 chapters in the hope of redemption or closure or anything to make me believe I hadn't wasted time on these books, but it was a hopeless cause. So being the mature person that I am (erm, sometimes), I tried to forget I ever read such a shitty piece of literature and moved on.I wouldn't have wasted more time on writing this review if it weren't for a friend of mine who said she wanted a boyfriend like Harry/Hardin. I was stumped and gave her a 40 minute lecture, which ended with me being called a grandma.(!!)If anyone's reading this, come out of your After ever happy bubble and smell the fucking coffee. Try to understand that what Hardin and Tessa had was not love. Or the kind of relationship you would want to aspire for. It was a disproportionate mess of lies, games, manipulation, emotional abuse, unhealthy attachments, unresolved mental issues and lots of sex! And I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that this book is a bestseller (and now, a movie deal?!) Just what the heck is wrong with everyone???",299,52

Another fanfiction P2P.
  
Except instead of using Twilight to establish a fan base, this idiot used British boybander Harry Styles. Now I'm not a fan of One Direction & Co in the slightest, but even I know how messed up this is.
  
No one knows how this POS/After got out of control. And yea, it is a POS. While reading through the first chapter I was mentally editing it in my brain. Run on sentences, lack of semicolons, past tense bullshit. And knowing that it was bought for six figures by one of the most recognized publishers in the world, Simon & Schuster.
  
The same publisher, mind you, responsible for Stephen King, Dan Brown, Becca Fitzpatrick, and R.L. Stine. 
  
A few reasons this book could (and probably will) bomb1) There's a damn petition for #suspendannatodd, to prevent this broad from fuckin up Harry Styles reputation.2)Yahoo has written an article slamming this book for being a piss poor rip off of Fifty Shades. 3)The author is a liar. It was revealed that the author, Anna Todd is 25, married, and not going to any educational institute. Whereas a year ago she was 18, single, and a student of neuroscience at UCLA. 4) Author says Styles will have no involvement in any of this mess, yet she keeps posting pictures of him as ""Harry"" and going on about After.5) The book is very monotone.6) It glamorizes Harry Styles as a rapist ect..All of the other publishers are probably shaking their heads...Harper Collins publisher:
  
Razorblade publishing:
  
Little Brown:
  
What's funny about all of this (Aside from the massive amount of views on Wattpad), is the fact that this book has thrived by 11-16 year old readers, who probably had to hide under their covers and read this POS via cell phone.Parents on release day:
  
Kids:
  
It's gotten so bad, in fact, that Harry Styles has blocked this author from Twitter. 
  
Read at your own risk, I guess. But I sure as hell won't recommend it. And yea, I'll be one of those people pushing Beautiful Disaster, Easy, and other titles in front of it at Books-A-Million.
  

  
    
      UPDATED 10/22/2014
    
  
The published version of after has finally hit shelves, so it's time to compare. Based on what I've read, I hope the editor got a BIG payday. (OLD UNEDITED VERSION: Beginning of Chapter 1)
  
(NEW EDITED VERSION: Beginning of Chapter 1)
  

  
Sorry to disappoint Harry Styles lovers & Co, but Todd can't write. An editor got a hold of that bad boy and tore it up.

22557520,After,Pearl Angeli,622,942,1,"July 23, 2017","First DNF book of the year.One of the things I hate doing so much is DNF-ing a book because it feels bad to leave it when you've invested yourself in it in the first place. But sometimes you just have to quit because it just doesn't work out for you. And you can no longer fool yourself and hope that things will get better as the story goes.So yeah.. I DNF-ed this book for these reasons:1. Writing Style - This book is poorly written and executed. I see so much potentials in this book but it fails to hold my attention most of the time because of the boring writing.2. Plot - You can never find an absolute plot in this book. Every chapter is a complete waste because of so many unnecessary scenes that don't make any sense at all.3. Main Characters - If you can't love the main characters, then there's no reason to continue it. Why pretend and fool yourself? Tessa and Hardin are both immature characters. They always bicker like children and wow, their childish behavior annoys the crap out of me! And don't even get me started on Hardin's attitude! Gaaah this guy makes me want to pull my hair out because he's simply such a prick! 4. Cheating - Just so we're clear, I despise books with cheating, but I admit that there are books that I loved even when there's cheating involved but that's because they're simply well-written and well-justified. But this? A girl cheats on her boyfriend just because her boyfriend is boring and omg there's a tattooed and pierced boy-next-door who's way hotter and exciting than him. What the actual f*ck? And damn Hardin. This guy! He knows the girl has a boyfriend and yet he continues to seduce her just so he can prove that he's a sex god!I did try to like this book, honestly. But I just can't. It was a waste of time. Nuff said.",250,51
